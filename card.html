			<p>The platypus is a carnivore and feeds on insects, larvae, and small shrimp. It uses its soft, leathery bill to sense electrical signals from its prey underwater. Male platypuses have a venomous spur on their hind feet, which they use for defense. They are excellent swimmers and can stay underwater for up to two minutes.</p>
